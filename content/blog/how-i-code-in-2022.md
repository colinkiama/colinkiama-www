## My System

I own a [Starbook Mk V](https://starlabs.systems/pages/starbook). I
wanted the most seamless experience possible with the OS of my
choice: [elementary OS](http://elementary.io) and wow, it delivers! It's fast,
smooth, gets regular firmware updates over [fwupd](https://fwupd.org/) and 
support is great (in terms of drivers, touchpad support and customer support).

Despite how slim it is, battery life is great. I average around 6-8 hours but 
on other operating systems like [Pop!\_OS 21.10](https://pop.system76.com/), 
I have gotten closer to the advertised maximum of 11 hours (around 8-10 hours).

Also, it's [super easy to open the system for self-repairs and upgrades](https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/guides/starbook-mk-v-complete-disassembly-guide). In fact
they even offer a 1 year open warranty (at time this article has been written).

If it sounds like I'm selling this laptop to you, yes I am. If you want a,
laptop made for Linux that is fast and "just works", this is it.

P.S. I'm writing this blog post with this laptop and it's been I haven't really
been concious of the hardware itself. The experience has been so seamless that I
just focus I'm just fully focused on writing this post instead.

## Operating System

I run [elementary OS 6.1 J√≥lnir](https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-6-1-available-now/)
on my main laptop.

I use it because it has the perfect balance of productivity and ease-of-use across
all Linux Desktops (just to clarify, this is **my personal opinion**).

Still though, I do have several parts that I really don't like about it but, there's
something about the aesthetics that makes me come back to the OS again whenever
I swap to a different one.

## Development Tools

### [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

I love that out of the box, it's pretty much a text editor with pretty decent,
built-in syntax highlighting.

It's lightning quick and native too (your RAM will thank you).

Thanks to [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
and the [Sublime Text LSP package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) that 
adds support for it to the editor you can add IDE-like features for the languages
of your choice while still having full control of the exact worfklow you want.

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

I use this for Version control

Thanks to Git, I can code features in parallel using feature branches.

If something goes wrong with my code, I can easily revert back to a working state.

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)

Not only is it an excellent browser, I'm also a big fan of the developer tool sections available there:

- Accessibility: Makes it much easier to test for [WCAG requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- (Web) Console: There's an option to open a side bar that let's you easily write multi-line JavaScript code.
- Also one of the only browsers that has actually implemented the [freedesktop color scheme preference](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734934).

## Design Tools

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

I make mockups and protoypes here before I start writign code that involves a UI.

By the way, it's **free** and works on all operating systems since it's browser-based!

## Special Mentions

### [Mozilla Developer Network Documentation (MDN Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/)

I'm exteremely grateful to live in a time when such a resource exists.
New things are being added to the web constantly. This website is a great way
of learing about what APIs are out there, what's possible and also,
which browsers support certain features.

### [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/)

I love how this website gets straight to the point. "Can I use X feature on my
website if I want to support at least browser version Y?"

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

My last resort.
