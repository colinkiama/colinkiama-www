## My thoughts

I feel like we could explore forums more

Reddit lets anybody create a community around a topic.

Discourse added a lot of dynamic social media-like interactions to the experience and allows you to host the whole experience yourself

And there are still the old reliable static ones still used in some places. No JS required xD

However, I havenâ€™t really seen a balance of user freedom and monetisation opportunities (that arenâ€™t ads). 

Any thoughts? ðŸ‘€ - send me an email with your response (there's email info below).
