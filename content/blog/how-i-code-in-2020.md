Here's what I use on my personal computer!

## Operating System

I run [Pop!\_OS 20.10](https://pop.system76.com/) on my main laptop.

It's based on Ubuntu and it's the fastest and most productive Linux distribution that I've ever used!

## Development Tools

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

My main code editor. It's has an easy to use layout, very customisable and is widely supported!

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

I use this for Version control

Thanks to Git, I can code features in parallel using feature branches.

If something goes wrong with my code, I can easily revert back to a working state.

### [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

I love the enhancements that it adds to my terminal!:

- Color-coding
- Developer environement information
- Current git status
- and more...

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)

Not only is it an excellent browser, I'm also a big fan of the developer tool sections available there:

- Accessibility: Makes it much easier to test for [WCAG requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- (Web) Console: There's an option to open a side bar that let's you easily write multi-line JavaScript code.

Also, it's one of the only browsers that reads that gets the "prefers-color-scheme" value from the Pop!\_OS, (As far as I'm aware)

## Design Tools

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/)

I make mockups and protoypes here before I start writign code that involves a UI.

By the way, it's **free** and works on all operating systems since it's browser-based!
