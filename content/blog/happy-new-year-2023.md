Happy New Year! There have been some big changes since my last blog post.

## Back to Windows

I switched from hopping between Linux distros to settling with Windows 11. I really value a predictable, well-supported environment. Windows 11 has also fixed a lot of the complaints I had about aesthetics of Windows 10. I’m pleased with what they are doing with Windows 11.

## Web Dev to Game Dev

After working over 2 years as a front-end developer, I’ve gained a pretty good understanding of web development, however, in that time period, I’ve been able to think a lot about what I want to do.

It turns out, game development is what I’m extremely passionate about, so I started learning some game engines ([Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/), [Unity](https://unity.com/)), programming languages ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)) and even took part in a few game jams on [itch.io](https://itch.io/). [Ninjump](https://colinkiama.itch.io/ninjump) is one of the games created for a game jam and is currently in the showcased on the [portfolio page](@/portfolio/index.md) of my website.

I’ll keep adding more games to my portfolio and developing my skills in the hopes that I do get to work on games professionally in the near future.

This journey has been super exciting so far and I’m looking forward to seeing where it takes me next!
