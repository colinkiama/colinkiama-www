## Intro

In the [previous blog](@/blog/making-four-in-a-row-part-3.md) post, you implemented player moves.

Now you're ready to check for wins and draws in the game.

## Checking for Wins

In four-in-a-row, there are three ways to for a player to win a game:

1. Place 4 consecutive tokens horizontally
2. Place 4 consecutive tokens vertically
3. Place 4 consecutive tokens diagonally.

Since the board in game has been created using an array of arrays, you can create check for consecutive tokens by iterating through the game board, checking each direction for win lines.

### Finding win lines

While the directions to check for wins are different, we still are checking for the same number consecutive tokens in each direction so, we can create a method that checks for the win lines for you.

Add a method to the `FourInARowGame` class called `tryFindWinLine`:

```js
/**
 *
 * options: {
 *     startRowIndex,
 *     startColumnIndex,
 *     rowCountStep,
 *     columnCountStep
 * }
 *
 * Any missing options will be 0 by default.
 */
tryFindWinningLine(board, options) {
    // If `options` is null/undefined, set it's value to an empty object.
    options = options || {};

    let config = {
        startRowIndex: options.startRowIndex || 0,
        startColumnIndex: options.startColumnIndex || 0,
        rowCountStep: options.rowCountStep || 0,
        columnCountStep: options.columnCountStep || 0
    };

    let count = 0;
    let tokenToCheck = Constants.BoardToken.NONE;
    let winLine = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < Constants.BoardDimensions.WIN_LINE_LENGTH; i++) {
        let row = config.startRowIndex + config.rowCountStep * i;
        let column = config.startColumnIndex + config.columnCountStep * i;

        if (this.checkIfOutOfBounds(row, column)) {
            break;
        }

        let currentToken = board[row][column];
        if (currentToken === Constants.BoardToken.NONE) {
            break;
        }

        if (tokenToCheck === Constants.BoardToken.NONE) {
            tokenToCheck = currentToken;
        }

        if (currentToken === tokenToCheck) {
            count++;
        }

        winLine.push({ row: row, column: column });
    }

    if (count === Constants.BoardDimensions.WIN_LINE_LENGTH) {
        return {
            winLine: winLine,
            winner: FourInARowGame.boardTokenToPlayerColor(tokenToCheck),
        };
    }

    return {
        winLine: []
    };
}
```

The method above counts checks for consecutive tokens from a starting position. The behaviour of this method is controlled by the `options` object that is passed in.

`startRowIndex` and `startColumnIndex` sets the start position.

The `rowCountStep` and `columnCountStep` controls the direction win lines will be checked in. For example: A `rowCountStep` of `0` and a `columnCountStep` of `1` will check for a win line horizontally from the start position.

There two other methods that are called in `checkForWinLine()`.

`checkIfOutBounds()` checks if a specified position is out of bounds. This allows us to stop checking for a win line early.

Add the method to the `FourInARowGame` class:

```js
checkIfOutOfBounds(row, column) {
    return row < 0
        || row > Constants.BoardDimensions.ROWS
        || column < 0
        || column > Constants.BoardDimensions.COLUMNS;
}
```

The other method is the a static one called `FourInARow.boardTokenToPlayerColor()` which turns board token values to player colour values.

Add it to the `FourInARowGame` class:

```js
static boardTokenToPlayerColor(boardToken) {
    switch (boardToken) {
        case BoardToken.YELLOW:
            return PlayerColor.YELLOW;
        case BoardToken.RED:
            return PlayerColor.RED;
        default:
            return PlayerColor.NONE;
    }
}
```

### Checking for wins in all directions

Now that you've created find win lines on the board, you're now ready to start checking if a player has won the game.

Create a new method to the `FourInARowGame` class called `checkForWin()`:

```js
// Each win line is an array of board position coordinates:
// e.g: winLine = [{row: 0, column: 0}, {row: 0, column: 1}, {row: 0, column : 2}, {row: 0, column: 3}]
checkForWin(board) {
    // Starts from bottom left of the board and ends on top right of board
    for (let columnIndex = 0; columnIndex < Constants.BoardDimensions.COLUMNS; columnIndex++) {
        for (let rowIndex = Constants.BoardDimensions.ROWS - 1; rowIndex > -1; rowIndex--) {
            // Check for vertical win
            let verticalWinCheckResult = this.tryFindWinningLine(board, {
                startRowIndex: rowIndex,
                startColumnIndex: columnIndex,
                rowCountStep: -1,
            });

            if (verticalWinCheckResult.winner) {
                return verticalWinCheckResult;
            }

            let horizontalWinCheckResult = this.tryFindWinningLine(board, {
                startRowIndex: rowIndex,
                startColumnIndex: columnIndex,
                columnCountStep: -1,
            });

            if (horizontalWinCheckResult.winner) {
                return horizontalWinCheckResult;
            }

            let leftDiagonalWinCheck = this.tryFindWinningLine(board, {
                startRowIndex: rowIndex,
                startColumnIndex: columnIndex,
                rowCountStep: -1,
                columnCountStep: -1
            });

            if (leftDiagonalWinCheck.winner) {
                return leftDiagonalWinCheck;
            }

            let rightDiagonalWinCheck = this.tryFindWinningLine(board, {
                startRowIndex: rowIndex,
                startColumnIndex: columnIndex,
                rowCountStep: -1,
                columnCountStep: 1
            });

            if (rightDiagonalWinCheck.winner) {
                return rightDiagonalWinCheck;
            }
        }
    }

    return {
        winLine: [],
        winner: Constants.PlayerColor.NONE
    };
}
```

This method above checks for win lines in all directions from each board position. It then returns a `WinCheckResult` which is made up of the a `winLine` which is a list of consecutive board positions and `winner`, which contains the who won the game.

Notice how the `rowCountStep` and `columnCountStep` values are set for each direction.

### Allowing players to win

Now that you have created a method that checks for wins, you can now detect wins and update the status of the game accordingly.

Update the `evaluateGame()` method so that it handles wins being detected:

```js
evaluateGame(board) {
    let winCheckResult = this.checkForWin(board);

    if (winCheckResult.winner !== Constants.PlayerColor.NONE) {
        this.status = Constants.GameStatus.WIN;
        return {
            board: board,
            winner: winCheckResult.winner,
            status: {
                value: Constants.MoveStatus.WIN
            },
            winLine: winCheckResult.winLine
        };
    }

    // From this point, we can assume that a successful move was made and the game will
    // continue on.
    return {
        board: board,
        winner: Constants.PlayerColor.NONE,
        status: {
            value: Constants.MoveStatus.SUCCESS
        },
        winLine: []
    };

```

Feel free to test this out in your browser's console.

When a move results in a win, the move result object in the output will have the `status` field with a value of `win`, `winner` will be set to either `Red` or `Yellow` and `winLine` will be filled with positions.

Subsequent calls to `playMove()` will produce the same output every time. The game is already over after all ðŸ˜‰.

## Checking for a draw

Not every four-in-a-row game concludes with a win. There are cases where the board is filled with no winner. In these cases, the game ends in a draw.

You're now going to add the ability to detect a draw.

First, add a method called `checkForFilledBoard()`:

```js
checkForFilledBoard(board) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board.length; j++) {
        let boardColumn = board[j];
        for (let i = 0; i < boardColumn.length; i++) {
            let boardPosition = boardColumn[i];
            if (boardPosition === Constants.BoardToken.NONE) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

Now, make another update to the `evaluateGame()` method so that it checks for a draw and if true, returns an `MoveResult` object that indicates that the game has ended with a draw:

```js
let winCheckResult = this.checkForWin(board);

if (winCheckResult.winner !== Constants.PlayerColor.NONE) {
  this.status = Constants.GameStatus.WIN;
  return {
    board: board,
    winner: winCheckResult.winner,
    status: {
      value: Constants.MoveStatus.WIN,
    },
    winLine: winCheckResult.winLine,
  };
}

// If board is full right now, we can assume the game to be a draw
// since there weren't any winning lines detected.
if (this.checkForFilledBoard(board)) {
  this.status = Constants.GameStatus.DRAW;

  return {
    board: board,
    winner: Constants.PlayerColor.NONE,
    status: {
      value: Constants.MoveStatus.DRAW,
    },
    winLine: [],
  };
}

// From this point, we can assume that a successful move was made and the game will
// continue on.
return {
  board: board,
  winner: Constants.PlayerColor.NONE,
  status: {
    value: Constants.MoveStatus.SUCCESS,
  },
  winLine: [],
};
```

Feel free to test out these changes out your self in your browser's console. The `MoveResult` object returned in the output will have a `status` field with a value of `draw`.

If you encounter any errors or unexpected behaviour then please go over the code you've written so far and read over this post again.

Otherwise, congratulations! You've now implemented the core logic of a four-in-a-row game in JavaScript.

In the upcoming posts in this blog series, you'll be working on the HTML5 Canvas front-end for your game and integrating the state machine object you've created into it!

That's all for now ðŸ‘‹!
